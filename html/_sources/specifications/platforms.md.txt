# Platforms

A distinction can be made between platforms.
The **target platform** and the **development platform**.
The former being the platform you'd like to run the game on.
The latter being the platform you use to develop the game with.

## Target Platforms

The Zel Game Engine will support multiple platforms in the future.
Right now the following platforms can be developed for:

- Windows

## Development Platforms

Right now only Visual Studio on Windows can be used with the engine.
We currently have no plans to expand beyond this.
