//TODO: Describe process to setup VS project

Hello World
-----------
To check if everything is working as we expect it to be, we can try to print something.

Change  `zel_initialization` to the code below

::

void zel_initialization()
{
		printf("Engine Init");
}

When we now run the program, we should be able to see the text appear in the command prompt.
If you don't see a command prompt when launching the program, make sure you selected the `Debug` configuration.

.. note:: Make sure you set Zel_Windows as the startup project in Visual Studio

.. note:: You can contribute to Godot's documentation by opening issue tickets
          or sending patches via pull requests on its GitHub
          `source repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_, or
          translating it into your language on `Hosted Weblate
          <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs/>`_.

Everything should now be working and setup correctly.
Well done!
